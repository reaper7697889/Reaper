# Reaper

Reaper is a versatile desktop application built with Electron, designed for personal knowledge management and note-taking. It empowers users to capture, organize, and connect their thoughts and ideas in various formats.

## Key Features

*   **Multiple Note Types:** Reaper supports a wide range of note formats to suit different needs:
    *   **Simple Notes:** For quick rich-text notes and ideas.
    *   **Markdown Notes:** For structured text documents with Markdown formatting, including support for backlinks to link related notes.
    *   **Block Workspace:** A flexible block-based editor (similar to Notion or Logseq) for creating complex documents and layouts.
    *   **Drawing Canvas:** For sketching diagrams, mind maps, or visual notes.
    *   **Voice Memos:** For capturing audio notes and thoughts on the go.

*   **Organizational Tools:** Keep your knowledge base structured and accessible:
    *   **Folders:** Organize notes into hierarchical folders.
    *   **Workspaces:** Create distinct workspaces to manage different projects or areas of focus.
    *   **Tags:** Apply tags to notes for flexible categorization and quick filtering.

*   **Knowledge Graph:** Visualize the connections and relationships between your notes through an interactive knowledge graph. This helps in discovering new insights and understanding the bigger picture.

*   **Cross-Platform:** Being an Electron application, Reaper can potentially run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Backend/Desktop Framework:** Electron
*   **Database:** SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`)
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   `Quill` / `react-quill` for rich text editing.
    *   `react-markdown` for Markdown rendering.
    *   `react-force-graph` for the knowledge graph visualization.
    *   And various other libraries for UI components and specific functionalities.

### Database

*   **Type:** SQLite
*   **File:** The application uses a SQLite database stored in the file \`database.sqlite\`, located in the root directory of the project.
*   **Initialization:** This database file is automatically created and its schema is initialized by the application on its first run if the file does not already exist.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get Reaper up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.
*   **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the repository. You can get it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Electron (Optional Global Install):** While the project will use a local version of Electron via npm, you might find it useful to have Electron installed globally for easier command-line use in some cases: `npm install -g electron`. This is not strictly required to run the project.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reaper-app.git
    cd reaper
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses npm to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    This command will start the Electron application.
    ```bash
    electron .
    ```
    The SQLite database (`database.sqlite` in the project root, as per `db.js`) will be automatically initialized on the first run if it doesn't exist.
